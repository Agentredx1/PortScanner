# PortScanner
Simple Port Scanner
Made following socket tutorials and reference from geeksforgeeks.org

When executed without any arguements, will scan NMAP.org at the domain name "scanme.nmap.org" at port 22
Otherwise, can be given 2 arguements,
  1. an IP address or Domain Name
  2. a specific port to scan
Default behavior when passed as arguements looks like:
python NetworkPortScanner.py scanme.nmap.org 22

TO DO:
  - option to scan ranges
  - better ui
  - try making it in c?
